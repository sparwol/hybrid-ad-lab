# Hybrid AD + Entra ID Initial Access Lab

This lab simulates real-world initial access and privilege escalation attacks in hybrid Active Directory / Entra ID environments, focused on regulated sectors like healthcare and critical infrastructure.

## Focus Areas
- Password spraying and account discovery
- Kerberoasting and delegation abuse
- DC Sync attacks with overprivileged users
- Entra ID MFA bypass & Conditional Access abuse
- Purple team detection with KQL and Sigma

## MITRE Coverage
- TA0001: Initial Access
- TA0003: Persistence
- TA0006: Credential Access
- TA0008: Lateral Movement

## Lab Setup
The environment includes:
- 1 Domain Controller (Windows Server 2025)
- 1 Entra ID-joined Windows 11 workstation
- 1 Hybrid Azure AD connector (Azure AD Connect)
- Defender for Identity + Sentinel (Optional)
